     SUMMARY: This file provides information on the locational relationship          
     between counties (and statistically equivalent entities) in the United          
     States. For purposes of this study, contiguous counties included those          
     that were physically adjacent, those that were not physically adjacent          
     but were connected by a major road, and those that were not physically          
     adjacent but had significant economic ties. The file includes FIPS              
     state and county codes, county names, and the type of relationship              
     between contiguous counties.

This file provides information on the locational relationship between counties       
(and statistically equivalent entities) in the United States. Counties are           
identified as having several types of contiguity: those having physical              
adjacency (including those areas separated by water but known at the Bureau to       
be linked by a bridge or regular transportation service), those that are nearby      
but not adjacent, and those that do not border but nevertheless are                  
economically integrated (measured by one-way commuting flows of at least 2,000       
people per day based on data from the 1980 census). This file, which was             
prepared originally as part of the work related to validating 1975-1980              
population estimates, has been updated through December 1991. The file includes      
FIPS State and county codes and the county names for all counties and                
statistically equivalent entities.

File Sort: Records are sequenced in the FIPS State and county code order of the      
base county.  The 1991 Contiguous County File records, within the base county,       
are sequenced by their FIPS State and county codes.
